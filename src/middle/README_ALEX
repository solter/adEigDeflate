The function to use is 'trainbust'.
You will note that I put 1 extra input and 1 extra output in the definition,
to run it as before just do put []'s into the extra spot.

As for the returned derivative value - see the comment at the top of the function
for a description of how I envision it. This could be flat out wrong,
so if it is please update the comment at the top of the trainbust to accurately
reflect what the derivative represents.

Furthermore, please leave commit messages specifying that you changed it
so I know without running diff.

Thanks,
-Peter
